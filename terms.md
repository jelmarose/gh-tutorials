## C
**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** - HTTP based mechanism that allows a server to load resources that does not share the same origin. Example: using Google Fonts or any CDN for your React JS app. Since using Google Font requires you to request a copy of a font via their CDN, your app needs to do a GET request from an external API. See Same-Origin Policy.

**Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.
